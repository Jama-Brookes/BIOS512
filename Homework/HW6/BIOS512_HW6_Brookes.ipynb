    "Using information from the plot, we can determine how many episodes these characters spoke in by how many total individual points plotted. We then can assess the importance of their roles by how many times they spoke in each episode (dialog_count) and the mean length of dialog when they spoke (mean_dialog_length). According to the plot, Picard was in many episodes (observed by the amount of points on the plot) and spoke often in the episodes with quite long dialog lengths on average. This suggests that Picard was a main character who often pushed the plot forward with their speaking role. In contract, Wesley was in a lot fewer episodes (observed by the fewer total points) and overall spoke a smaller amount of times with smaller average dialog length. This would suggest that Wesley was potentially a minor character or had a less frequent, supporting role."

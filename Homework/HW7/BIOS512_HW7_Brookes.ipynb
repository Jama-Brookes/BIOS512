    "# Homework 7\n",
    "Student name: Jama Brookes\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is based on the advanced Git lectures. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "#### What is the holy trinity of Git? (Just name the parts.)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Branch, Staging Area, and Working Copy\n",
    "```"

    "## Question 2\n",
    "#### Explain how patches relate to the idea of committing a change to the history of your code?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Patches provide line by line information on what is needed to transform a file \n",
    "into a new version, which can be applied to a file. When it is applied to a file, \n",
    "it changes the file in the working directory but these changes are not a part of \n",
    "the projects history until they are committed. However, we can commit these changes \n",
    "to alter the main branch if we wanted to. The history of the repository can be \n",
    "thought of as a bunch of committed patches.\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "#### What is the difference between a branch and a fork?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "A branch points to a commit and is the history of your code. \n",
    "A fork is permanent copy of a repository and is separate from the original.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "#### How are diff and patch related? What’s the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "`Diff` provides human-readable and machine readable files outlining \n",
    "the differences between two files in commits, branches, or working directories. \n",
    "The output of `diff` is used by `patch` to organize the differences line by line. \n",
    "This information can then allow you to transform one version into another version. \n",
    "The difference between `diff` and `patch` is `diff` just provides all differences \n",
    "between two files while `patch` records all needed information needed to transform \n",
    "the file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "#### See the diagram below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "alice            *-*-*-*-d-e     \n",
    "bob              *-*-*-*-a-b-c\n",
    "origin/main      *-*-*-*-a-b-c\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### a) What part of the Git trininty does each line represent?\n",
    "```\n",
    "Branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b) What would the result be if Alice performed a rebase? Edit the diagram. What would she type in the terminal to rebase, then push?\n",
    "```\n",
    "alice            *-*-*-*-a-b-c-d'-e'    \n",
    "bob              *-*-*-*-a-b-c\n",
    "origin/main      *-*-*-*-a-b-c-d'-e'  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git rebase\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) What would the result be if Alice performed a merge? Edit the diagram. What would she type in the terminal to merge, then push?\n",
    "```\n",
    "alice            *-*-*-*-d-e-a-b-c    \n",
    "bob              *-*-*-*-a-b-c\n",
    "origin/main      *-*-*-*-d-e-a-b-c \n",
    "```\n",
    "Code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git merge\n",
    "git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### d) Which would be the better option (rebase vs. merge)? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Rebase is the better option because rebase hides Alice's current \n",
    "changes/working draft and adds the most recent commits from the \n",
    "origin/main branch with Alice's changes on top. \n",
    "This creates a more linear history.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "#### Match the command/vocab word to the description.\n",
    "You can edit the table!"

    "git diff\n",

    "#### b) What git command would you use to start interactive staging?\n",

    "If you do not exit interactive mode, we could use option `a` \n",
    "to stage current hunks and all remaining hunks or go hunk by hunk \n",
    "by choosing different numbers to stage. You can commit these changes \n",
    "by exiting and then committing. \n",

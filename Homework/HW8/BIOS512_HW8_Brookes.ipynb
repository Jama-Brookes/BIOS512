    "\n",

    "Vectorizing! It repeats entries to create an index vector that then can be easily compared in on vectorized operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "#### When does `kmeans` fail? What assumption does `kmeans` use that causes it to fail in this situation?\n",
    "Kmeans fails when we do not have spherical Gaussian data with similar standard deviations. For example, if we have two layered rings of groups, kmeans would not be able to classify the \"inner\" and \"outer\" rings as groups. It would also fail if we have elongated groups that were not circular in nature. This is because this data is not spherical Gaussian data and they would not be roughly the same size, which is a kmeans assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "#### What assumption do Gaussian mixture models make?\n",
    "Gaussian mixture models do not require that each cluster to be the same size because it assumes that the N Gaussian distributions have individual parameters calculated from the data. This allows Gaussian mixture models to identify clusters that are elongated or unequal sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "#### What assumption does spectral clustering make? Why does this help us?\n",
    "Special clustering makes very minimal assumptions on the data. It assumes that two points close to one another are likely to be in the same cluster. Because it does not rely on a vector space, it groups two things together by any critera. This helps us because it can identify points in similar clusters based on a criteria (like distance). It then creates a Graph Laplacian, which maps the connections. This then can be runned through kmeans to create clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 7\n",
    "#### Define the gap statistic method. What do we use it for?\n",
    "The gap statistic method compares the clustering results for different numbers of clusters (k) to randomized data in the same data range. The tightness or density of the observed data is compared to the tightness and density of the randomzied data with the same number of k clusters. This is used to identify the best number of clusters to use to prevent overfitting or underfitting the data.\n"
